# *devkit*
*Old description*

A C "library" that gives the user some handy tools (inspired, or basically copied) from other languages (mostly if not only Java, though many features are present in most languages) that are missing in standard C. This is obviously a concept and should not be used for serious projects.

*New description*

A C library that gives the user some handy tools to work with, including a debugger (yet to be developed). This was originally meant to bring some comfy features from other languages (like enhanced for cycles), but is now trying to become somewhat suitable for C development.

I will eventually make a documentation for this, but for now i'm focusing on making this library usable
